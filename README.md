### Notes
This week's content was not particularly difficult to follow. Improvements to do is auto layout for the detail pages. I am still currently trying to figure out how to hook up the movie trailer to the movie poster. Specifically, I need to figure out how to get the url request and parse the data to get the Youtube URL.

### Notes
What was challenging about this assignment was understanding how the code works with one another. Instead of mindlessly copying what the instructor did for the lab, I had to take pauses to research and understand how each step is relevant to making this app. Other than that, the requirements and challenges was a nice start to IOS application.
